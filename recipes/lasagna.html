  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the Ingredients you will need:</p>
    <ul><li><strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>:You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong>:For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>:A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>:This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Noddles</strong>:Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together). </li>
